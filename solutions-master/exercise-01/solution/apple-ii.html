    <title>Apple II | Flynn's Retro Computers</title>

  <!--
    Let's take a moment to think about the title. The site title is
    "Flynn's Retro Computers, but the page title is "Apple II." We
    want to combine both here so we don't lose sight of what site
    and page we're on.

    Order is a judgement call, but still matters as tabs offer limited
    real estate. If you feel it's more important to highlight the
    section of the site, Apple II" should appear first. If your site
    brand is more important, go with "Flynn's Retro Computers." ...

    <h1>Flynn's Retro Computers</h1>
    <h2>Apple II</h2>

    <!--
      ... However, order matter *does* matter here. Site title before
      page title. We use an h2 because "Apple II" can be viewed as
      a subtitle.

      This means when we use headings later on in our page, we'd begin
      with h3.
    -->

    <ul>
      <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="apple-ii.html">Apple II</a></li>
      <li><a href="commodore-64.html">Commodore 64</a></li>
      <li><a href="trs-80.html">TRS 80</a></li>
    </ul>

    <!--
      There are two ways we can handle our site navigation: include all
      links or include all links except the current page. The latter
      option might look like:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li>Apple II</li>
        <li><a href="commodore-64.html">Commodore 64</a></li>
        <li><a href="trs-80.html">TRS 80</a></li>
      </ul>

      Either way is fine when building a basic web site. Styling allows
      us to 'fake' removal of the link; it can still be clickable, but
      look as if it is not.

      Did you notice the file names for the pages and images follow a

    <p>The <strong>Apple II</strong> (stylized as <strong>Apple ][</strong>) is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak. Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.</p>

    <p>The computer included a <abbr title="Metal Oxide Semiconductor">MOS</abbr> Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1.023 <abbr title="megahertz">MHz</abbr>, two game paddles (no longer bundled as of 1980 because they violated <abbr title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr> regulations), 4 <abbr title="kilobyte">KB</abbr> of <abbr title="random access memory">RAM</abbr>, an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer <abbr title="Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr> programming language built into the <abbr title="read-only memory">ROM</abbr>s. To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing has rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998.</p>

      Notice the entry for "CPU", which has nested tags. We open with
      strong, then abbr. After the content, we close abbr, then strong.
      Always close the most recent open tag first.

      The following would be incorrect:
