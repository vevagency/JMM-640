# READ ME

## HTML Best Practices


### Objectives

- Develop a workflow for debugging
- Apply best practices to HTML
- Become familiar with the [W3C Validator](http://validator.w3.org)


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-03` (or `exercise-03-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- fix-me.html
- flynn.jpg
- quorra.jpg

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-03` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

The file `fix-me.html` is incorrect and broken.

1. Change the name of the file to be `index.html`.

2. Following what you have learned in the "HTML Best Practices" lecture, fix the document.

3. At the end of the exercise, [validate your code](http://validator.w3.org). Make sure there are no errors either in existence from the beginning or introduced as you fixed the file. Make sure the page appears correctly in the browser -- the validator does not pick up all mistakes in this exercise!


### How to tackle this project

**Read the task.**

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down the task to be completed. When you finish, check it off.

Decide on the next task to tackle.

It is okay if you get stuck. Set aside the task giving you trouble, decide on another and move on. Be sure you have written down the task giving you trouble (so you can spend time on it later).


### Am I done?

It is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you *are* finished, delete your work and code it again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.


### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
