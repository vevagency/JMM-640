          <p>Mark Zuckerberg helped create the modern world by connecting nearly a quarter of its citizens to Facebook and giving them a platform to share, well, everything - baby pictures and Pepe memes, social updates and abusive bullying, helpful how-to videos and live-streamed violence.</p>

        <!--
          Here is a judgement call: We can group each of these <h3>s
          and <img>s into <article>s, but since each <article> would
          be pretty sparse, it may not be necessary. It will depend
          on your design; if you find a need to group these for
          styling purposes, the <article> tag would be appropriate
          (and a better choice than <div>).

          Either way, whatever pattern you choose (<article> or not),
          you want to be consistent in how you apply it.

      <!--
        The next four sections are secondary navigation, so including
        them within the footer is acceptable. It's also acceptable
        to have these stand alone as individual sections outside of
        the footer - - some sites do have what we'd call additional
        content as part of the main.

        In either case, though, the content indicates these are links
        to other parts of the site, so we should include these within
        <nav> tags.
