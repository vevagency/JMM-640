    <h1>Web Images</h1>

    <p>Original Image: 1.9MB</p>

    <!-- NOTE: Your image sizes may vary. These percentages are based
    on the default settings of Low, Medium, High, etc. You should work
    within the ranges (i.e. Low-Medium) to see what balance you can
    find between your image being of tolerable quality and low file
    size.

    There is no right or wrong answer to this, as every photo you make
    adjustments to will have a different outcome. For instance, images
    with a lot of red will show 'jaggies' because of the way jpeg
    compresses the color red.

    You want to get a feel for how you can push the limits of size and
    quality - - which is what this exercise is about. And, of course,
    it gives you practice using Photoshop for re-sizing and exporting
    images! :) -->
