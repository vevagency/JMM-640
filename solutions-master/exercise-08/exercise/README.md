## CSS: Descendent Selectors


### Objectives

- Use descendent selectors
- Use font- and color-related properties.
- Experiment using new properties.


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-08` (or `exercise-08-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- img
  - vintage-hardware.jpg
  - vintage-software.jpg
- index.html

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-08` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-08` folder. (It may be named `exercise-08-master`.)

Other than correcting any validation errors, broken links/images or adding a link to your style sheet, you **MAY NOT** modify any of the HTML.

With the exception of `body`, `header` and `footer` all other rules will require use of **descendent selectors**.

If instructions require you to use a property you haven't seen, look it up. Explore!

1. In `index.html`, make sure all links work, the images appear and the code validates. Do not continue to the next step until these are corrected.

2. Create a new directory called `css` inside `exercise-08`. Next, create a style sheet named `style.css`. Save this file in the `css` folder within `exercise-08` folder. Link to the style sheet in `index.html`.

3. Set the `body` font size to 14 pixels, the font-family to a sans-serif typeface (you may choose to use a specific typeface or the generic default), font color to `#222` and the line height to 1.5.

4. Set the `header` to have a background color of `#eee`.

5. Set `em` tags within the `header` to have a font weight of bold.

6. Set `a` tags within the `header` to have a background color of `#eee` and a font color of `#444`. `a:visited` tags within `header` should have a background color of `#444` and the color should be `#eee`.

7. Within the `aside`, set `img` to have a border width of 3 pixels, a border style of `solid` and a border color of `#222`.

8. Set the `em` tags inside the aside to have a font style of `italic`, a font color of `#999` and a font size of 10 pixels.

9. Let's add some unique styles to each section. Under `#hardware`, the `h2` should have a font color of `rgb(218,58,51)`. Apply the same color the `img` border. Under `#software`, apply the same rules, but using the color `rgb(21,88,218)`.

10. Set the `footer` to have background color of `#222` and a font color of `#eee`.

11. Set `a` tags within the `footer` to have a font color of `#eee` and `a:visited` tags to have a font color of `#444`.

12. Set the `small` content inside `footer` to have a font size of 10 pixels.

If you complete all these tasks, feel free to experiment with other selectors, properties to style the page as you see fit.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?
- Is my style sheet properly linked?
- Are my selectors correct?
- Do my properties exist? Are there typos?
- Does the property accept the value I am giving it?
- Is all my CSS punctuation there?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
