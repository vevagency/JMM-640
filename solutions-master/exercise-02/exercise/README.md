## Tables

### Objectives

- Review HTML basics
- Become familiar with tables


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-02` (or `exercise-02-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- main-content.txt

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-02` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

1. Create a file, `index.html`. Add the document structure for your web page. This should include `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags. Make sure your code is properly nested.

2. Mark up the content with appropriate semantic tags (i.e. headings, paragraphs, etc.).

3. Build the tables. You may use the attribute/value `border="1"` to help visualize the table.

  - The first table is a basic table. Text written in CAPS should be a table heading. All other information should be considered data.

  - The second table is a complex table; there will be rows which span multiple columns. After building a simple version of the table, fix the first column containing "macOS"; and the last column containing "Apple" and "Linux" so these entries span multiple rows.

  - The last row of the table ("* available Fall 2018") should span all columns.


### How to tackle this project

**Read the task.**

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down the task to be completed. When you finish, check it off.

Decide on the next task to tackle.

It is okay if you get stuck. Set aside the task giving you trouble, decide on another and move on. Be sure you have written down the task giving you trouble (so you can spend time on it later).


### Am I done?

It is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you *are* finished, delete your work and code it again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.


### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
