## CSS Basics


### Objectives

- Style a document using basic CSS
- Use type, id and class selectors
- Use font- and color-related properties.


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-07` (or `exercise-07-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- index.html

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-07` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-07` folder. (It may be named `exercise-07-master`.)

1. In `index.html` is an abridged version of the U.S. Constitution. Make sure the HTML file contains [valid](https://validator.w3.org/) code. Never assume the code you receive in exercises is 'clean.'

2. Identify the sections which contain the document's `preamble`, `articles` and `amendments`. Give each an id with the value of its respective contents. In the navigation menu, provide links to the Preamble, Articles and Amendments sections you just added id to.

3. The first 10 amendments are known as the Bill of Rights. Add a class attribute to these articles together using the value `bill-of-rights`. (Do this in `main`, *not* `nav`.)

4. Create a new directory in `exercise-07` called `css`. Create a new style sheet in `css` named `style.css`. Link to the style sheet in `index.html`.

5. Set the `body` font to use a sans-serif typeface (i.e. `Helvetica` or `Arial`). Make the font color `#222`. Set the font size to 16 pixels.

6. Set the anchor (`a`) color to `rgb(233,87,80)`. Set the anchor's visited state (`a:visited`) to `rgb(15,97,165)`.

7. Set the `header` font size to 24 pixels.

8. Set the font style of the `nav` to italic.

9. Set the background color for the `preamble`, `articles` and `amendments` to be #eee.

10. Set the background color for the `bill-of-rights` articles to be `#ccc`.



### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?
- Is my style sheet properly linked?
- Are my selectors correct?
- Do my properties exist? Are there typos?
- Does the property accept the value I am giving it?
- Is all my CSS punctuation there?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
