# CSS Grid

Welcome to the **wonderful** world of CSS Grid!

If you have learned any sort of web layout technique(s) prior to this year, I have bad news: we've been hacking the web. The early creativity of web designers forced us to adopt properties and techniques which were never designed to do proper layout as we have in print for years. But we somehow made them work through many headaches and tears.

All major browsers implemented the CSS Grid specification in 2017. This has been a development [20 years in the making](https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators). We can finally lay out web pages in a simple, logical way, without hacks (as it should be).

## Special Thanks

To [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) and [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) who have been at the forefront of CSS Grid advocacy and implementation. Without you, we'd still be crying over float- and positioning-based layouts. Thank you for ending our 20 years of web layout pain and suffering.
