## CSS: Floats


### Objectives

- Use float and clear properties.


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-11` (or `exercise-11-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- css
  - style.css
- examples
  - better-alignment.png
  - example.png
- index.html

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-11` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-11` folder. (It may be named `exercise-11-master`.)

Review `example.png`. Your challenge is to replicate this following the steps below.

Other than correcting any validation errors, you **MAY NOT** change any of the HTML.

1. Create a CSS block for `div` which sets the width to 200 pixels, height to 200 pixels and the background color to `rgb(242,87,30)`.

2. Create a CSS block for `section` which sets the width to 600 pixels. Add a 1 pixel, solid border with its color as `#222`. This will help you visualize what is happening as you float each box.

3. Follow the instructions inside `index.html`. The first box should float left, the second one right and the third left.

4. Notice the sections are collapsing. Apply the necessary properties to `section` to fix this.

5. Adjust the margin to provide whitespace between each box and the text next to it.

6. Clear the last paragraph marked with a class of `clear-me` so it begins on a new line, after the box. You may want to adjust the whitespace so the text is not up against the box.

**BONUS:** If you notice, text dips below the top of each box. This is a design sin; the text and box should be aligned (as seen in `better-alignment.png`). Write a new CSS block which uses a box model property to fix this.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?
- Is my style sheet properly linked?
- Are my selectors correct?
- Do my properties exist? Are there typos?
- Does the property accept the value I am giving it?
- Is all my CSS punctuation there?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
