  <!-- This is a comment in HTML. It will not appear anywhere in the
  web browser. -->

  <!-- We always start the document with the <html> tag. This tells
  the browser the file we're giving it is coded in HTML. -->

  <head>

    <!-- The <head> contains content we (generally) do not see. -->

    <title>My web page</title>

    <!-- The contents of the <title> tag appear in a browser tab. -->

  </head>


  <body id="start">

    <!-- The <body> contains all content we see in the web browser.
    Think of it as your canvas!

    id="start" is something for a link we have set up below. It
    is not required when building a page - - <body> will suffice.

    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>

    <!-- Heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc ... up to <h6>) are HTML's
    versions of headlines, subheads, sub-subheads. They establish
    an informational hierarchy. Do not use them in order. Use them in
    the way you would for outlining information. -->

    <p>This is a sentence.</p>

    <!-- The <p> (paragraph) is pretty much the most common tag. If
    your content isn't in a list, it will probably be wrapped in
    <p> tags. -->

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>

    <!-- We're starting a subsection which demonstrates lists. This
    is why we're using an <h2>. We'll have three sections in our
    'Lists' section, therefore, we'll use an <h3> for each of those.
    When we're done with 'Lists', we'll create a new section and
    use an <h2>. -->

    <!-- When we create lists, there are two parts: 1. the type of list
    and 2. the list items. We cannot use the list items by themselves.
    We must discern what kind of list those items are a part of!

    Ordered lists will preface each item with a number; unordered lists
    preface items with bullets. -->

    <ol>
      <li>California</li>
      <li>Texas</li>
      <li>Florida</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Here, the order of our list matters; it indicates the order of
    U.S. states by highest population.

    Notice when as the <ol> tag is open, we indent our tags. This is
    called 'nesting'. We should be nesting our tags throughout the HTML
    document. -->

    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>cat</li>
      <li>fish</li>
      <li>dog</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- By using <ul>, we're saying the order of the list items does
    not matter. -->

    <h3>Definition Lists</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>hurricane</dt>
      <dd>A tropical storm with winds greater than 74 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- Definition lists are slightly different. They require two
    parts: the term (<dt>) and definition (<dd>). This format is ideal
    for glossaries. -->

    <!-- Some notes about the <abbr> tag. It is used to identify
    abbreviations or acronyms. By itself, it doesn't have much value.
    We use an attribute - - title - - and the value provides the detail
    about what the abbreviation means; in this case, mph means "miles
    per hour".

    By default, a dotted underline appears under text wrapped in an <abbr>
    tag when a title attribute is included. (If there's no title attribute,
    it looks ... unchanged.) When a user hovers over the text, a tooltip
    will appear with the contents of the title. -->


    <h2>Links</h2>

    <!-- Links never stand alone. They are usually part of some other
    component of our web site, such as a paragraph, list, etc.

    The <a> tag requires the href attribute (href stands for 'hypertext
    reference'). We can link to:

    1. An external web site.

    2. A page within our web site.

    3. A section within our web page.

    The following two examples address Nos. 1 and 2. -->

    <p>Sebastian the Ibis is the mascot of the <a href="http://miami.edu">University of Miami</a>.

    <!-- When we link to an external web site - - a site other than our
    own, we need to give it a 'fully qualified domain name'. This means
    we have to indicate the protocol used (in this case 'http' or
    'https' - - the 's' stands for secure), followed by the URL
    ('uniform resource locator' - - or more easily described as a web
    address).

    We can't just write 'miami.edu' because the browser will not know
    that address is a web site. It's the 'http(s)' which tells us the
    address is a web site. -->

    <p><a href="more-tags.html">More Tags</a></p>

    <!-- If we only want to link to a page inside our own site, we just
    have to indicate the file name (and the path to that file). In this
    case, more-tags.html is in the same directory, so we can just use
    the filename as the value.

    We will have an in-depth lecture on paths to files, but for now,
    keep all of your files in the same directory, reference the file
    name in href (or 'src' - - which we will see later) and you will
    have no problems! -->

    <p><a href="#start">Return to Top</a></p>

    <!-- It is also possible to link to a specific point on a page. In
    this case, we need the link and we also need to supply the
    destination - - in this case, the beginning of our page. This is
    what id="start" is on our body tag; this link points specifically
    to the tag with "start" as an identifier.

    The hashtag (#) indicates we are looking within the page. The text
    which follows tells us which id the browser should look for on the
    page. The hashtag is not included in the id value.

    We will have a more in-depth lecture on the id attribute. -->

  </body>
