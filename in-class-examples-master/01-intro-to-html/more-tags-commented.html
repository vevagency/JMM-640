    <h1>More Tags</h1>

    <p><a href="index.html">My First Web Page</a></p>

    <!-- Whenever we link from a page, it is generally a good idea to
    link back. We'll get into more details about linking before we
    start building our web site. -->


    <h2>Images</h2>

    <img src="sebastian.jpg" alt="Sebastian the Ibis, University of Miami mascot" />

    <!-- <img> is a self-closing tag. As you can see, there is no text
    to be wrapped. The 'src' attribute refers to the image file we want
    displayed. (Again, as long as everything is in the same directory,
    we only need to reference the file name.)

    There is also the 'alt' attribute. This is *VERY* important. For
    one, it provides alternate text for people using screen readers. It
    gives search engines context as to what that image is. Finally, if
    for some reason the image never loads or the image path in 'src' is
    broken, that text will appear on the web page. It is a multi-
    purpose fallback. -->


    <h2>Text</h2>

    <!-- Quick reminder: We are starting a new section, so we'll use
    <h2> for the heading. -->

    <p>The Gators are going to have a <em>good</em> season.</p>

    <p>The Hurricanes are going to have a <strong>really good</strong> season.</p>

    <p>There is absolutely nothing here to <i>emphasize</i>. <b>Okay?</b></p>

    <!-- While <em> (emphasis) and <strong> (strong emphasis) make text
    appear italicized and bold, respectively, we don't care about the
    visuals. Remember: these *visual* enhancements mean nothing to
    search engines or those who have visual impairments.

    So we don't use <i> or <b> because they're easier ... we use <em>
    or <strong> to provide context to the information we are sharing.
    In this case, we're saying the words within <em> and <strong>
    really (or really, really) matter.

    In the paragraph where we use <i> and <b>, the words marked up with
    these tags have no extra meaning. Where would we use these? If, say
    we were writing a bibliography and text needed to be italic; we
    wouldn't use <em> to emphasize a book name; we just need it to be
    styled in italics to meet proper formatting requirements. -->


    <blockquote>
      <p>Go Canes!</p>
      <p>&mdash; Sebastian the Ibis</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- A blockquote is like a pull quote. We generally use the <p>
    tag within.

    What's the &mdash; do?  It creates a 'medium dash' (â€”). We could
    type the medium dash in our code editor and the browser should pick
    it up. But some older browsers may not. When this happens, we need
    to use a specially encoded character known as an 'HTML entity'.

    All HTML entities start with an ampersand (&). They are followed by
    either a small bit of text or a special number which transforms in
    the browser.

    A good search engine for this is:

    http://www.amp-what.com/

    It will give you the HTML entity codes for all characters - - even
    emoji! -->


    <p>This sentence has a footnote.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>H<sub>2</sub>O is water.</p>

    <!-- We can create superscript (<sup>) and subscript (<sub>).
    Pretty self-explanatory. -->

    <p>The curfew is from <del>midnight</del> <ins>10 p.m.</ins> to 5 a.m.</p>

    <!-- If we want to show changes to a document, we can use the
    <del> tag to show information which has been deleted; the <ins>
    tag to show information which has been added.

    Some blogs / web sites make it common practice to use these tags
    to show changes. It's an honest and transparent way of presenting
    information.

    (Newspapers and other major media outlets tend to just add
    corrections to the bottom of the page since it keeps the copy
    clean for the reader.) -->


    <h2>Tables</h2>

    <!-- Review the example below as well as the information in your
    book. You may want to try building a table on your own.

    Identify what each part of the table is. What is a <tr>?
    What about a <th>? How is that different from a <td>?

    Notice the 'State' column has 'Florida' in each row. Learn how
    to use the 'rowspan' attribute to make one 'Florida' appear
    in both rows (as if the cells merged). Also, instead of 'City'
    and 'State' table header, we can combine this into a header which
    spans both the city and state and is titled 'Location'. Learn
    how to use the 'colspan' attribute to do this. -->

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>School</th>
        <th>City</th>
        <th>State</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Sebastian</td>
        <td>Miami</td>
        <td>Coral Gables</td>
        <td>Florida</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Albert</td>
        <td>Florida</td>
        <td>Gainesville</td>
        <td>Florida</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
