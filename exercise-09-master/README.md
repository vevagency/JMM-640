## CSS: Box Model


### Objectives

- Use box model properties.


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-09` (or `exercise-09-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- css
  - fancy-boxes.css
  - style.css
- fancy-boxes.html
- fancy-boxes.png
- index.html

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-09` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-09` folder. (It may be named `exercise-09-master`.)

Other than adding a link to your style sheet or correcting any validation errors, you **MAY NOT:**

- Change the HTML
- Use `width` or `height` properties.

`index.html` and `fancy-boxes.html` each contain multiple `div`s with unique ids. You will style these using **only** padding, border and margin (shorthand or more the more detailed version(s)) properties.


#### `index.html`

1. Link the `style.css` in the `index.html` file. There are rules which already exist in `style.css`. Do not change these unless noted. You will need to use an id selector to style each box.

2. **box01**: Set the background color to `rgba(28,104,167,1)`.

3. **box02**: Set the background color to `rgba(28,104,167,0.8)`. Add 20 pixels of padding. (You may use individual properties (i.e. `padding-top`) or the shorthand property.)

4. **box03**: Set the background color to `rgba(28,104,167,0.6)`. Add 20 pixels of margin. (You may use individual properties (i.e. `margin-top`) or the shorthand property.)

5. **box04**: Set the background color to `rgba(28,104,167,0.4)`. Add a border which is 2 pixels wide, of dotted style and has a color of `rgba(28,104,167,1)`. Add 20 pixels of padding. Add 20 pixels of margin.

You have finished with `index.html`!


#### `fancy-boxes.html`

1. Open `fancy-boxes.html` and link the `fancy-boxes.css` style sheet. Again, there are rules which already exist in `style.css`. Do not change these unless noted.

2. View `fancy-boxes.png`. Recreate this example using box model properties. (Remember, you may **only** use padding, border and margin. You may use individual properties or shorthand, but you may need a combination of both. If you need a value for any padding or margin, use 20 pixels. If you need border values, use a width of 2 pixels and a color of `rgba(28,104,167,1)`.

If you complete all these tasks, feel free to experiment with other selectors, properties to style the page as you see fit.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?
- Is my style sheet properly linked?
- Are my selectors correct?
- Do my properties exist? Are there typos?
- Does the property accept the value I am giving it?
- Is all my CSS punctuation there?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
