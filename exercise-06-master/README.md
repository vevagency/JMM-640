## Directory Paths


### Objectives

- Properly organize the files of a web site
- Use relative paths to link documents, images together within an organized structure


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-06` (or `exercise-06-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- cat-bg.png
- charlie.html
- charlie.jpg
- coby.html
- coby.jpg
- flynn.html
- flynn.jpg
- index.html
- piper.html
- piper.jpg
- quorra.html
- quorra.jpg
- style.css
- zedo.html
- zedo.jpg

Do not move any files *outside* of this directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-06` folder. (It may be named `exercise-06-master`.)

**You may not re-name files or move them into a different directory structure other than what is displayed below.**

1. Organize the files as follows. You may choose to organize the files using the 'Tree View' (left column) in Atom, or in the macOS finder. All names without an extension (i.e. .html, .jpg, etc.) are directories. Create the directories, then place the files within them as indicated.

- black-n-white
  - charlie.html
- css
  - style.css  
- egyptian-mau
  - piper.html
- img
  - cat-bg.png
  - charlie.jpg
  - coby.jpg
  - flynn.jpg
  - piper.jpg
  - quorra.jpg
  - zedo.jpg
- index.html
- snowshow
  - coby.html
- tabby
  - flynn.html
  - quorra.html
- tux
  - zedo.html


2. Make sure the step above is complete. If it is not, you cannot complete this exercise.

   Open each HTML file. Find the tags which have properties such as `href` (for links and the css file) or `src` (for images) and link them using **relative paths**.

   Start the process with `index.html`.

2. Look at documentation (or a previous example?) for how to add a stylesheet with a `link` tag. Make the styles contained in `style.css` appear on the web page. What properties are necessary to make the stylesheet work?

3. Fix `style.css` so it includes `cat-bg.png` as a background. In `style.css`, look on line 2 for: `background: url("");` What is the path to `cat-bg.png`?

4. When you finish, check each page to make sure the links work and images appear. This means clicking on a link to make sure it works, going back to the page you came from and clicking the next link in the list. Just because a link works on one page does not mean it is correct on another!

The exercise is complete when all links are working and images appear.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.


### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.


### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
